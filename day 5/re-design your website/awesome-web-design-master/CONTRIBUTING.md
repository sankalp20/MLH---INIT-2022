# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Only submit something unique and generally useful.
- If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list, argument how it's better.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[package](link): Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!
