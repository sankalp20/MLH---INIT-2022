ROSTERS LAST UPDATED: 3/15/16

Running Game.java will be able to simulate a game (currently bulls vs. warriors, but you can change that)
Running Season.java simulates the rest of the regular season and the playoffs (from 3/15/16)

teams.txt is a list of teams

nba_schedule.txt is a csv of the remaining schedule downloaded from basketball-reference.com (I believe the only changes I made were deleting the games already played and renaming 'trail blazers' to 'trailblazers' by removing the space)

Teams is a folder containing all the team files we need to use, see TeamFilesFormat.txt for info on what the numbers mean. Each team should have a current record on the first line and a series of 10 players on the following lines. Each player line should have the format specificed in TeamFilesFormat.txt
